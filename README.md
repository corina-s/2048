## 2. Background and Overview
2048 is a one player 2D sliding block puzzle game where blocks with numbers are combined to add their values.

The rules are that on each turn the player must choose a direction (up, down, left or right) and all tiles move as far as possible in that direction, some more than others. 
Two adjacent tiles (in that direction only) with matching numbers combine into one tile bearing the sum of those numbers. 
A move is valid when at least one tile can be moved, if only by combination. 
A new tile with the value of 2 is spawned at the end of each turn at a randomly chosen empty square, if there is one. 
To win the player must create a tile with the number 2048. The player loses if no valid moves are possible.

2048 is primarily built with JavaScript,React Html and CSS.
